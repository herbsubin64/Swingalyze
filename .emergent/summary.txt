<analysis>
The previous AI engineer initiated work on swingalyze to resolve an Upload timed out after 15 seconds error. The trajectory details an iterative process: first, building a Bulletproof Video Upload system, then restoring full AI Golf Swing Analysis with Ghost Skeleton functionality. Key issues addressed include backend streaming, frontend UI, timeout extensions, and mobile upload compatibility. A significant turning point was discovering a discrepancy between the AI's Create React App build and the user's actual Vite deployment. This led to a complete rebuild of the frontend within a new  directory, aligning with the Vite architecture. Subsequent fixes involved refining video file validation and debugging frontend JavaScript runtime errors, finally leading to a network-accessible local testing environment.

<product_requirements>
The user initially reported an Upload failed: Upload timed out after 15 seconds error on the swingalyze application, explicitly requesting support for all video formats and elimination of timeouts. Following the successful fix of the upload timeout, the user then requested to restore all functionality to swingalyze including superimposing ghost skeleton, indicating a full golf swing analysis application. Subsequent requirements focused on fixing a non-functional upload button on iPad, which led to multiple iterations addressing iOS/Safari compatibility, event handling, and JavaScript runtime errors. Finally, the user provided deployment configuration files, revealing the application's true Vite-based architecture, necessitating a complete migration of the developed features to this new framework, followed by local and network testing.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (CRA and Vite), FastAPI, MongoDB.
-   **Video Processing**:  for streaming uploads, MediaPipe and OpenCV for AI-powered pose detection and ghost skeleton superimposition.
-   **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS for styling, React state management, drag-and-drop interfaces, mobile responsiveness,  for development/build.
-   **Backend**: Asynchronous I/O with FastAPI, file handling, robust error handling, API routing ( prefix).
-   **Environment Management**:  for process management,  files for environment variables.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application consists of a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. Initially, the frontend was assumed to be a Create React App (CRA) structure within . Later, it was discovered the actual deployment used a Vite-based React project, leading to the creation of a new structure at .

**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Core backend logic, FastAPI endpoints, video upload handling, AI analysis integration, file validation, storage.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Initial implementation for bulletproof video upload (using , ).
        -   Integration of AI swing analysis (MediaPipe, OpenCV) for pose detection and ghost skeleton overlay.
        -   Extended timeout for analysis endpoints.
        -   Enhanced file validation logic (signature, size checks) to prevent processing invalid video files.
        -   Improved error handling and response status codes.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Lists all Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes**: Added To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , ,  and others for video handling and AI processing.

-    (and related components in ):
    -   **Importance**: Original frontend entry point and components for the CRA project.
    -   **Changes**: Multiple iterations to implement video upload UI, progress tracking, analysis display, mobile responsiveness, and fixing event bubbling issues. *This version is now superseded by the Vite version.*

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main entry point for the new Vite-based React frontend. Orchestrates the different features and components.
    -   **Changes**: Rewritten to integrate all SwingAlyze features (upload, video library, real-time analysis, results) within the Vite/TypeScript environment. This now includes the  component and logic for calling the backend APIs.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles the core video upload functionality in the Vite frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Designed for robust touch handling, drag-and-drop, and mobile compatibility, including  for direct camera access on mobile devices, and displaying upload progress and error messages.

-    & :
    -   **Importance**: Defines Node.js dependencies and the build/development configuration for the Vite project.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch to set up the Vite environment, including  and  for API calls.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment-specific variables for the Vite frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Created to correctly configure  for the Vite environment, ensuring API calls target the correct backend.

<pending_tasks>
The trajectory does not explicitly list any pending tasks that were discussed but not implemented. The AI engineer has consistently addressed user feedback and proceeded with fixes and new implementations as requested.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed the migration of the SwingAlyze application to a Vite-based React project (located at ), addressing the deployment configuration discrepancy. All previously implemented features, including the Bulletproof Video Upload system, robust file validation, AI-powered golf swing analysis with ghost skeleton superimposition, and iPad-optimized UI/upload functionality, have been integrated into this new Vite structure.

The AI engineer has successfully started the Vite development server in the background (on port 5173, accessible via  and ). An  file containing  has been configured for the Vite frontend to ensure correct communication with the FastAPI backend. The latest action was providing the user with the network URL () and detailed instructions for testing the fully functional SwingAlyze application on an iPad via the network. The application is currently in a state ready for end-user testing of all restored and new functionalities.
